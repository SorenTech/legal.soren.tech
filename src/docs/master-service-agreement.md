The best work comes out of great relationships. Honesty, respect and gratitude are the keys to a great relationship and therefore we have an interest in treating each other with these values at all times. As much as legal documents are important, what truly binds us is our drive to do great work with great people and to develop a relationship of mutual respect and trust.

With that said, these terms and conditions (the “Terms”, or the “Agreement”) will govern the relationship between Us (Soren LLC) and You, the Client. These terms and conditions apply to the attached Statement of Work, which defines the scope, timeline, and budget for the work we will undertake together (the “Work”). We will not perform the Work apart from Your acceptance of these Terms. This Agreement may NOT be transferred by You to another party: it is only valid for You.

This Agreement, along with and any exhibits, schedules or attachments, between the Parties supersedes any previous arrangements, oral or written, and may not be modified in any respect except by a future written agreement signed by both Parties.

Throughout these Terms, “Deliverables” refers only and exclusively to those items listed in the section of the attached Statement of Work titled “Deliverables.” We would love to help You with additional projects, but they require an additional Agreement and attached Statement of Work/Agreement. “Services” refers to our work for You to complete the requested Deliverables.

**TERM AND TERMINATION:**

Our Agreement with You begins on the date designated in in the Statement of Work. Our Agreement with You ends either (a) on the expiration date designated in the Statement of Work, (b) when You accept the Deliverables as complete, (b) when more than 15 days have passed since we submitted the Deliverables to you and we have received no response either approving the Deliverables or requesting a cure, or (d) when We agree to an Early Termination for any reason.

Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, upon 15 days written notice.

Either Party also may at any time terminate the Agreement immediately if: (i) the other party commits a breach of this Agreement and such party does not cure a breach within 5 days of written notice from the other party, or (ii) One of the parties of this agreement becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors.

In the event of Early Termination, You agree to pay for all work We have performed and any expenses or fees incurred by Us up to the date of Termination, as declared in writing by Us. We agree to use Our best efforts to minimize such costs and expenses.

Termination for any reason shall not affect the rights granted to You by Us hereunder. Upon termination, We shall pay to You all undisputed amounts due and payable. If upon termination You have not paid undisputed fees owed for the Deliverables or Services provided by Us as of the date of termination, You agree not to use any such material or the product of such Service, until You have paid Us in full. Any provisions or clause in this Contract that, by its language or context, implies its survival shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, We shall retain a perfected security interest in the Deliverables until You have made payment in full for all undisputed amounts as of the termination date. We hereby agree to release and waive Our security interest in the Deliverables upon receipt of full payment for all undisputed amounts.

We shall be free to work with other clients so long as such work does not present a conflict of interest or result in the disclosure of Confidential Information (defined below).

**NON-SOLICITATION, NON-CIRCUMVENTION, NON-COMPETITION:**

- (b) any attempts, either directly or indirectly, to call on, solicit, or take away any of the other party’s customers or clients.

Both parties recognize that a breach of these obligations shall entitle the other party to a legal monetary penalty equal to the maximum service it should realize from such a diverted or circumvented transaction plus any and all expenses, including legal, that would involve recovery of these funds.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SUITABILITY, COMPLETENESS OR RESULTS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE WORK.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH HEREIN, ALL DELIVERABLES ARE DELIVERED ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS.

We make no guarantees whatsoever about the quality, reliability, suitability or safety of any third-party services included as part of the Deliverables, integrated with them, or used to host or deliver them, including any services We acquire or manage on Your behalf.

**CONFORMITY, TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE OF DELIVERABLES:**

We agree that all completed Deliverables will fully conform to the specifications, requirements and other terms set forth in the Statement of Work.  If You determine that the Deliverables do not conform to the Specifications, You may request a Cure so that it conforms to the Specifications within ten (10) days of such notice (the “Cure Period”). The Cure Period may be extended at Our discretion upon written notice to You of the reasons for such an extension. Such a cure may only consist in the correction of deficiencies in Deliverables submitted to you as “complete” or “finished” works— it may not be requested for preliminary works, including but not limited to presentations, writings, ideas, concepts, designs, plans, sketches, markups, wireframes, prototypes, models— and may not include substantial modifications to the Deliverables or the addition of new features.

**RIGHTS RETAINED AND DISTRIBUTED:**

*(a) Materials Owned by You*

At all times You retain the exclusive ownership of any materials created or otherwise owned by You, including, without limitation, your existing logos, written content, and trademarks.

Any third-party materials used in this Project may come with their own licensing requirements. You agree to abide by all such licensing requirements and respect the rights of the owners of such third-party materials.

You may not reproduce or distribute any such preliminary works without Our express written permission.

You agree that We retain ownership of all computer code or scripts produced by Us, including, without limitation, all HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, SQL, JSON, and all other materials that We conceive or develop in connection with Our Services for You, including materials incorporated therein whether such materials were conceived or created by Us individually or jointly, on or off the premises of Client, or during or after working time). We grant You, upon payment of all fees due to Us pursuant to this Agreement, a worldwide, irrevocable non-exclusive, royalty free, sub licensable, non-attribution license to use, modify, create derivative works, or otherwise exploit the work product.

*(d) Rights Distributed to You*

We agree that all deliverables and materials developed pursuant to this Agreement and not covered by other arrangements described herein (including, without limitation, all website text copy, images, graphics, and other materials that We conceive and develop pursuant to this Agreement, including all materials incorporated therein whether such materials were conceived or created by Us individually or jointly, on or off the premises of Client, or during or after working time) shall be treated as if the development of such deliverable constitutes a “work for hire” and shall be owned by You upon payment of all fees due to Us pursuant to this Agreement.

In the event that any such material is considered not to be a “work made for hire,” We hereby assign all ownership (whether represented or not by a registered patent, copyright, trade secret) and other proprietary or rights, title and interest in such deliverables and materials to You, and agree to execute such documents as You may reasonably request, in order to assist You in obtaining and protecting such rights.

We agree that We have no interest in any  such materials that We submit to You, including, without limitation, any security interest therein, and hereby release to You any interest therein (if any) which may be created by operation of law. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing and as necessary in the performance of this Agreement, We shall have no rights to license, sell or use the deliverables or materials developed under this Agreement, or any portion thereof.

*(e) Authorial Attribution and Showcase of Work*

All Deliverables will include authorial attribution, placement and prominence to be agreed upon by both parties, which You agree to maintain in a visible and identifiable manner.

You hereby agrees that We may use the Deliverables as part of Our portfolio and websites, galleries and other media solely for the purpose of showcasing Our work but not for any other purpose. We will not publish any confidential or non-public work without Your prior written consent.

**ASSISTANTS:**

We may, at Our own expense, employ or engage the services of such employees, subcontractors, or partners, as We deem necessary to perform the Services (collectively, the “Assistants”). The Assistants are not and shall not be employees of the Client, and You shall have no obligation to provide Assistants with any salary or benefits. We shall be wholly responsible and shall remain liable for the performance of the Services by the Assistants in a manner satisfactory to You.

You agree not to make any effort to hire said Assistants directly or otherwise employ said Assistants yourself for the duration of this Agreement and a period of twelve (12) months following its conclusion. Should you violate this term, You agree that you will be responsible for paying Us the full amount of the proposed budget for this project, even in the event that You choose to terminate the project before completion, in addition to any other remedies we may seek under the provisions of this Agreement.

**PAYMENTS AND EXPENSES:**

By accepting this Agreement and attached Statement of Work, You agree to the Schedule of Charges listed in the section of the attached Statement of Work titled “Budget.” You agree to make all payments on time and in full. Late or incomplete payments will compound interest at a rate of 1% per month, compounding. Please note that registered nonprofits (US 501(c)3’s or national equivalent) will be given a 30-day grace period before interest begins to compound. In the event that We begin charging interest on a late payment, We will also freeze ongoing work until payment is received. Returned checks will incur a penalty of either $25 or 5% of the balance, whichever is less.

Sometimes projects incur additional expenses, such as research costs, travel expenses, or specialized subcontracted services/products required to complete the project (including but not limited to services such as professional photography or products such as proprietary software licenses required by Your specific needs). We will always make every effort to notify You in advance of any expected additional expenses. When We do incur additional expenses, we pass them along to you using the following formula: (a) individual travel and research expenses less than either 1% of the expected total project budget listed in the Statement of Work or $50, whichever is smaller (the “individual incidental expense allowance”), are written off as “incidental” until such time as the cumulative total of “incidental” expenses goes above 3% of the expected total budget or $150, whichever is smaller (the “cumulative incidental expense allowance”), (b) all non-“incidental” expenses, including all specialized subcontracted services/products, individual research and travel costs greater than the “individual incidental expense allowance,” and any “incidental” expenses in excess of the “cumulative incidental expense allowance” are passed on to you. Travel expenses, such as mileage, airfare, and meals, are passed along at cost or at the rate designated by the Internal Revenue Service, as applicable. Other expenses are passed along at a 50% mark-up. Sometimes it is possible for You to directly purchase items that might be billed as an expense. If that is possible, We will try to inform You so that you can make those arrangements.

Before work can begin, We must receive a deposit of 20% of the expected project budget. After we begin work, We will send You additional invoices at regularly recurring intervals as described in the attached Statement of Work. In general, the terms of invoices will be Net+30, but We can make other arrangements upon request or in special circumstances.

**LIMITED LIABILITY AND AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY:**

We agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Client from any and all claims, actions, damages, and liabilities (excluding, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses) arising (i) through Our gross negligence ; (ii) out of any claim that the materials or deliverables, or any portion thereof, in fact infringes upon or violate any proprietary rights of any third party, including but not limited to patent, copyright and trade secret rights; or (iii) from a breach or alleged breach of any of Our representations, warranties or agreements herein.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Soren LLC (and it’s members, employees, agents, and representatives) from any and all claims, actions, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses) arising (i) in any manner caused by Your gross negligence; (ii) out of any claim that materials You provided, or any portion thereof, in fact infringe upon or violate any proprietary rights of any third party, including but not limited to patent, copyright and trade secret rights; or (iii) from a breach or alleged breach of any of Your representations, warranties or agreements herein.

The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights.

**FORCE MAJEURE:**

Neither party shall be deemed in breach of this Agreement for any delay, cancellation, or damages caused by any Force Majeure, including fire, earthquake, labor dispute, act of God or public enemy, death, illness or incapacity, any local, state, federal, national, or international law, governmental order or regulation, cyber or hacking attack, act of war, act of terrorism, civil unrest, vandalism, extreme weather, or any other event beyond the control of the parties.
