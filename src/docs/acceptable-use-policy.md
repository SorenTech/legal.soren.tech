**RESOURCE USAGE AND SECURITY**

Your account(s) with Our Service may have designated resource limits, as agreed. We do not actively disable accounts until they greatly exceed an acceptable level of usage. We will advise You of any overage and assess relevant fees as necessary.

Except where expressly permitted by law, You may not translate, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or make derivative works from the Services or from any websites We operate (collectively, the "Sites"). You hereby agree not to use any automatic device or manual process to monitor or reproduce the Service or Sites, and will not use any device, software, computer code, or virus to interfere or attempt to disrupt or damage Our Services or Sites or any communications on them. If You do not adhere to this provision, in addition to monetary damages and other remedies available to Us, You hereby agree to pay liquidated damages of $10,000.00 plus any and all fees associated with recovery of these damages, including attorneys' fees and costs.

Any violation of the security of the Services and/or Sites is prohibited and may result in criminal and civil liability. Unauthorized Access of the servers used to provide the Services, Sites, and/or related materials (collectively, the "Servers") is strictly prohibited and is a violation of this AUP. You agree not to engage in such activity or to attempt to breach the Servers for the purpose of altering or manipulating the hardware and software, compromising the Servers, or for any other unauthorized use commonly known as "hacking." In addition, You are prohibited from the following:

Additionally, any violation of these security provisions may, at Our sole discretion, be grounds for immediate Termination for Cause of Your access to the Services.

**ANTI-SPAM POLICY**

We consider any dissemination of unsolicited commercial email (i.e., "spam") to be prohibited.

We may, at Our sole discretion, immediately terminate any account which we believe to be transmitting or otherwise connected with any spam or other unsolicited bulk email.

Although federal law allows the dissemination of unsolicited bulk email under certain, tightly regulated conditions, we have elected to adopt a stricter, total spam ban policy. Spam, in all its forms, is annoying and burdensome, and is inconsistent with Our company values. Consistent with this commitment and our policies, we prohibit types of Spam that have not yet been contemplated by the law, including:
- Spim or instant messenger Spam;
- Spamming of internet newsgroups;
- Spamming on Craigslist or other classified services, except in areas designated for such use;
- Use of any personals service to Spam other members; and
- Any other method of Spamming.

In short, we define spam as either (a) sending a message to a recipient who does not know you, in some capacity, or (b) posting an ad somewhere that is not "on topic" and properly listed.

**INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT**

Soren respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask You to do the same. We reserve the right at any time to implement a 'notice and takedown' procedure upon receipt of any notification of claimed infringement. We reserve the right at any time to disable access to, or remove any material or activity accessible on or from any site or any materials claimed to be infringing or based on facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.

If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please notify us using the procedure provided in our [DMCA Policy](/dmca-policy).

**TERMINATION AND ACCESS RESTRICTION**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate Your access to any or all Services and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, with or without notice, for violating this AUP. Your rights and obligations upon termination of any Service are governed by the relevant Terms of Use or Service Agreement for the Services in question. Upon termination of the Service, your right to use the Service immediately ceases. We shall have no obligation to maintain any content upon termination of the Services.
