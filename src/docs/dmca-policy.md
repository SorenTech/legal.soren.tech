**COUNTER NOTICES**

If You believe that Your User Content that has been removed from the Site is not infringing, or that You have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in Your User Content, You may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Company via email at joysandconcerns@soren.tech:
- Your physical or electronic signature; 
- A description of the content that has been removed and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed; 
- A statement that You have a good faith belief that the content was removed as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and 
- Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that You consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in New York and a statement that You will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. 

If a counter-notice is received by the Company, the Company may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing such person that it may reinstate the removed content in 10 business days.  Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may (in the Company’s discretion) be reinstated on the Site in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice.
