**REGISTRATION AND TERMINATION**

You must be of legal age to form a binding contract between Yourself and Us and not precluded or barred from receiving the Services under the laws of Your country of residence in order to register for and use the Service.

All subscriptions to Our Services are subject to formal acceptance by Us. Your subscription to the Services will be deemed accepted by Us when We deliver confirmation of the subscription to You. We reserve the right to refuse to provide You with any Service for any reason.

The Initial Term for any Services shall begin upon confirmation of Your subscription or commencement of the Services to You and receipt of lawful funds. The term’s length shall be indicated at the time of commencement. After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms, equal in length to the Initial Term, unless terminated or cancelled by either party as provided herein. The term of any free service offered to you shall be perpetual until terminated by either party.

Either Party may terminate Your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause, upon thirty (30) days written notice.

Additionally, We reserve the right to terminate this Agreement effective immediately in the event that We find, based on Our sole judgment, that You or any of Your end-users have
- (i) violated the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP),
- (ii) have infringed or violated any intellectual property right or privacy or publicity right of a third party, or
- (iii) have used the Service in a way which, based on Our sole judgment, severely compromises its security or integrity and/or infringes on the ability of others to use the Service.

Either Party also may at any time terminate this Agreement immediately if:
- (i) the other party commits a breach of this Agreement and such party does not cure a breach within 10 days of written notice from the other party, or
- (ii) One of the parties of this agreement becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors.

In the event this Agreement is terminated, You agree to pay for all use of the Service and any expenses or fees incurred by Us up to the date of Termination, as declared in writing by Us. We agree to use Our best efforts to minimize such costs and expenses.

Parts of the service may require You to create a personalized account which includes a unique username and a password to access the Service and to receive messages from the Company (or Third-Party provider). You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time You register to use any of the Services. You agree to notify Us immediately of any unauthorized use of Your password and/or account. THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LIABILITIES, LOSSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR MEMBER NAME, PASSWORD AND/OR ACCOUNT.

**RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES**

We remain open to conducting similar tasks or activities for clients other than You and hold Ourselves out to the public to be a separate business entity.

Our relationship to You shall be that of an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or agency relationship between Us and You.

You may neither share nor re-sell Your access to the Services to any third parties.

Unless You have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Us, You agree that You will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, or resell the Services for any purpose.

Any license to use any third party applications is granted directly from the original provider of the third party application(s) directly to You. You agree to abide by all the terms and conditions of any such license. You will be solely responsible for paying for and obtaining the rights to any third party applications You install and/or operate through and/or in connection with the Services, and for compliance with the applicable terms and conditions of each third party application license.

Some of the Services may require that You establish Your own account with one or more third party providers. You will be solely responsible for paying for and establishing an account ("Provider Account") with each third party provider You select, and for compliance with the terms of use applicable thereto. You agree to abide by the terms of service and acceptable use policy of each third party provider that You use through the Services (if any). You must provide Us with Your Provider Account credentials (the "Credentials") that are necessary for Us to access and manage Your use of the third party provider services, including, without limitation, accessing services as necessary to identify or resolve technical problems or to respond to any issues related to or connected with your use of Our Services. We will use reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality and security of Your Credentials.

The Company has also established its own accounts ("Company Provider Accounts") with third party cloud providers, which We may use to provide You with the Services. We will be responsible for paying for and establishing the account with such Cloud Providers, provided that You will be responsible for paying Us the portion of the Cloud Provider fees allocated to You (included in Your service fees to Us), and for compliance with the terms of use applicable thereto.

**BILLING AND PAYMENT**

Payment for Services is due in advance of the time period for which such payment covers. Services are billed on an automatic and recurring basis unless You cancel the Service. You agree to pay any and all taxes, including personal property, value added, or sales taxes, resulting from Your use of the Services.

Invoices shall, in general, have terms of Net-30 unless separately negotiated by You and Us. Late payments shall begin to accrue interest at a rate of 1% per month compounding after they are 30 days past due. Should We begin to charge interest on a late payment, We will also freeze Your access to the Service until payment has been received. Returned checks or payments for insufficient funds will incur a penalty of $25 or 5% of the balance due, whichever is less. You also agree to pay all attorney and collection fees arising from Our efforts to collect any past due fees.

We are not responsible for any bank fees incurred by You due to Your use of check cards, automatic payment Services, insufficient funds, and any and all other fees Your financial institution may impose due to Your use of the Services.
